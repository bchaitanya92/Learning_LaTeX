The confluence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) is creating a new era of intelligent systems (AIoT).
AIoT empowers devices to analyze data and automate tasks, transforming industries. Within AI, explainability and ethical development are crucial, ensuring transparency and fairness in decision-making. Robust security measures are also paramount. On the IoT front, processing data closer to its source (edge AI) and the rollout of 5G networks are accelerating innovation. Additionally, blockchain technology is being explored to bolster security and streamline transactions within IoT systems. As AI and IoT continue their independent advancements, these trends, when combined, hold immense potential to revolutionize various sectors - shaping a future brimming with intelligent and interconnected technologies.
